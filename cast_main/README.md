## Branches

- `iso-fail-1`: a working `progress` version of the system
  - treat `int`, `\x. ...`, `castup (castup ... v)`, `castup (castdn ... v)`, `castdn (castdn ... v)` as values
  - however, the push rule works directly on the `castup` and `castdn` terms, which creates an overlapping for the value and reducible terms
